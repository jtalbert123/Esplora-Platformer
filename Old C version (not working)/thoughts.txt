	After some new information, I have decided to define the various structs
we are using is separate files. This will allow for more modular code and
hopefully better organization. Also, I am switching from a large array with
mostly NULL items to an array of the items that do exist.
As such all items will have an x and y coordinate in addition to the char.

	Also, the coordinates are doubles. This is to enforce separation of
the game update engine, and the render engine.

NOTE: any changes to a header file must be recompiled before compiling the .c files.
use "gcc level.h Drawable.h ActiveElement.h Utilities.h" to compile the header files
use "gcc level.c Drawable.c ActiveElement.c Utilities.c" to compile the .c files
